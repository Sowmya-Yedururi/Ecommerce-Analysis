## Challenges Encountered

- Handling null values in datasets.
- Establishing relationships between datasets.
- Ensuring data accuracy during cleaning and transformation.

## Key Findings
Product Categories and Pricing:

High-priced items generally received lower review scores.
Some categories outperform others in terms of both sales volume and customer satisfaction.

- Products with higher review scores had better sales performance.
- Delays in delivery negatively impacted review scores.
- Customer demand is higher in urban regions, aligning with efficient logistics coverage.
- Most transactions were completed via credit cards, with a preference for installment payments.
- Sellers with more diversified product portfolios had better sales metrics.

## Recommendations
- We recommend optimizing pricing for underperforming categories while maintaining competitiveness in high-demand segments. Offering discounts or bundle deals can further incentivize purchases in lower-rated categories.
- Leveraging customer feedback to improve product features and resolve common complaints will help boost satisfaction. Additionally, engaging with customers who leave poor reviews can foster loyalty and improve brand perception.
- Focusing on reducing delivery delays and prioritizing faster deliveries in high-demand urban areas will enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
- Using geolocation insights, tailored marketing efforts can unlock untapped regional potential. Seasonal promotions of highly rated products will further drive sales growth.
